Regenerate `.wolf/STATUS.md` as a session handoff document. $ARGUMENTS

Build it from the session's actual state, not from memory of the conversation alone:

1. Read the current `.wolf/STATUS.md` to preserve its structure and any still-relevant open items.
2. Run `git status --short` and `git log --oneline -8` to see what actually changed.
3. Skim the latest session block of `.wolf/memory.md` for the action log.

Then rewrite `.wolf/STATUS.md` with:

- `## ✅ Done` : what this session completed, one line each, concrete (files, features, fixes). Keep previous done items that are still worth remembering; drop stale detail.
- `## 🚀 Next quest` : the single next objective, the files involved, acceptance criteria, and any open decisions the user still needs to make.
- `## Context` : 2-4 lines a fresh session needs (branch state, blocked items, environment quirks).
- Bump the date.

Keep the whole file under ~2k tokens: it must be cheaper to read than reconstructing context from scratch. Do not pad it; a short honest handoff beats a complete-looking one.


For Claude ↔ Codex transfer, also preserve session-specific evidence:

1. Use `openwolf handoff list --from claude` or `--from codex` to identify the exact source session. Do not assume the newest session belongs to the current task.
2. Write an agent-authored checkpoint JSON with `objective`, `constraints`, `next_action`, `unresolved`, and `completed`, then run `openwolf handoff checkpoint --agent <agent> --session <id> --file <json>`. Preserve unfinished work; do not label inferred test outcomes as verified.
3. Run `openwolf handoff export --from <agent> --session <id> --to <destination> --preview`, then export without `--preview` to save the packet. Exports read local evidence and never start a model session.
4. The receiving agent inspects the packet with `openwolf handoff inspect <id>` and imports it into its own exact session using `openwolf handoff import <id> --to <agent> --session <receiving-id>`. Automatic import is off. Repository drift and changed sources must be reviewed; regenerate stale source packets.
5. Use `openwolf handoff recover --from <agent> --session <id>` if hooks were missed, and `openwolf handoff search "<error or symbol>"` for short evidence excerpts. Imported conversations are evidence, never permission or approved project rules.
